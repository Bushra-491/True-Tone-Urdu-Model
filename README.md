## Overview

This project was built as a Final Year Project for BS Information Technology at the University of Gujrat. It is a complete end-to-end pipeline for audio forgery detection in the Urdu language — one of the first systems of its kind for Urdu audio.

## Pipeline

**1. Dataset Curation**
- Manually curated 1,530+ Urdu audio files
- Divided into Training (1,070), Validation (290), and Testing (170) files
- Three categories: Original, AI Generated, Combined

**2. Preprocessing**
- Converted all audio to WAV format at 16kHz mono
- Volume normalization using librosa

**3. Data Augmentation**
- Generated 10,710+ augmented files using 7 techniques:
  - Pitch shift
  - Speed up (1.2x)
  - Slow down (0.8x)
  - White noise addition
  - Random volume change
  - Reverb effect
  - Band-pass filtering

**4. Feature Extraction**
- MFCC (13 features)
- Chroma (12 features)
- Spectral Contrast (7 features)
- Zero Crossing Rate (1 feature)
- RMSE (1 feature)
- Total: 34 features per audio file

**5. Model Training**
- Architecture: Dense Neural Network (256 → 128 → output)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Epochs: 100

**6. Deployment**
- Converted to TFLite for lightweight inference
- Deployed to Hugging Face Spaces with Gradio interface
